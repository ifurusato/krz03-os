KRZOS: Operating System for the KRZ03 Robot
*******************************************

**KRZOS** provides the core functionality of the *KRZ03 Robot*, a Raspberry
Pi-based robot OS written in Python 3.

.. note::
    2025-08-30: the KRZ03 project has been retired, as development is now
    focused on its successor, the KRZ04.

Background
**********

The *KRZOS* library provides essential support designed as the basis of a
`Behaviour-Based Robot (BBR) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-based_robotics>`_.
This library is relatively "low-level" and, in theory, could be used for any Python 3 
based robot.


Functional Description
**********************

The basic function is for sensors or other data sources to act as "Publishers" in a
"Publish-Subscribe" model, firing messages onto an asynchronous message bus. Messages
contain an Event type and a data payload. Subscribers to the message bus can filter 
which event types they are interested in. The flow of messages are thus filtered
by the Subscribers, who pass on to an Arbitrator messages they have consumed. Once all
Subscribers have acknowledged a message it is passed to a Garbage Collector (a specialised
Subscriber).

Subscribers can themselves act upon received messages, though generally these types of 
reactions are typically reflected as direct outputs such as lighting and sound effects,
or used to monitor sensor thresholds, which upon reaching may themselves publish messages
to that effect, such as low battery warnings, or high-priority bumper events.

The robot's movement is not controlled by Subscribers but by higher-level Behaviours,
which are all Subscribers and sometimes even Publishers. Some Behaviours are characterised 
as "servo", meaning they may execute continually (when active) and their effect on the 
robot may be intermixed with other Behaviours. Some Behaviours are "ballistic", meaning
they take over the complete function of the robot during the duration of their activity,
like a human reflex action, a hand touching a hot stove.

For example, a Roam (servo) Behaviour may be running, with the robot moving freely across 
the landscape. It subscribes to a DistanceSensorsPublisher which publishes proximity and 
bumper events, and also monitors a MotorControllerPublisher for motor change events. If 
Roam receives a message either indicating a bumper has been triggered or the motors have
stopped (due to being too close to an obstacle), Roam is suppressed and an Avoid (ballistic)
Behaviour is released. The robot will begin whatever the Avoid Behaviour entails, perhaps 
stopping, backing up while turning clockwise, then suppressing itself and releasing Roam
to proceed again on a new trajectory.


Software Features
*****************

* message and event handling
* an asynchronous message bus that forms the basis of a `Subsumption Architecture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture>`_ [#f1]_, with an "exactly-once' message delivery guarantee
* YAML-based configuration
* timestamped, multi-level, colorised [#f2]_ logging
* written in Python 3 (currently 3.11.2)

.. [#f1] Uses finite state machines, an asynchronous message bus, an arbitrator and controller for task prioritisation.
.. [#f2] Colorised console output tested only on Unix/Linux operating systems.

Requirements
************

This library requires Python 3.8.5 or newer. It's currently being written using 
Python 3.11.2. Some portions (modules) of the KRZOS code will only run on a 
Raspberry Pi, though KRZOS Core should function independently of the various Pi 
libraries.

KRZOS requires installation of a number of dependencies (support libraries). 
There is currently no dependency management set up for this project.

The pimoroni-iopxpander library supports the Pimoroni Breakout Garden 
IO Expander as well as the Encoder and Potentiometer.

The original PiconZero library has been included and significantly refactored as
a Python class, so it is not an external dependency.

To improve performance, if you don't need the avahi-daemon, disable it:

   sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon


Status
******

* 2025-08-30: the KRZ03 project has been retired, as development is now focused on its 
  successor, the KRZ04.

* 2023-2024: Early days. The Phase 0 hardware is largely complete and migration and 
  conversion of the `KROS-Core <https://github.com/ifurusato/kros-core/tree/main>`_ is 
  being used as the basis of MROS, which was forked to create KRZOS.
