KRZOS: Operating System for the KRZ03 Robot
*******************************************

**KRZOS** provides the core functionality of the *KRZ03 Robot*, a Raspberry
Pi-based robot OS written in Python 3.

Note: this document is a work-in-progress and does not necessarily reflect the
current state of the project.

Background
**********

The *KRZOS* library provides essential support designed as the basis of a
`Behaviour-Based Systems (BBS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-based_robotics>`_.
This library is relatively "low-level" and, in theory, could be used for any Python 3 
based robot.

The basic function is for sensors to act as "Publishers" in a "Publish-Subscribe" model,
firing event-laden messages onto an asynchronous message bus. Subscribers to the bus can
filter which event types they are interested in. The flow of messages are thus filtered
through the Subscribers, who pass on to an Arbitrator messages they have consumed. Once all
Subscribers have acknowledged a message it is passed to a Garbage Collector (a specialised
Subscriber).

Each event type has a fixed priority. The Arbitrator receives this flow of events and
passes along to a Controller the highest priority event for a given clock cycle (typically
50ms/20Hz). The Controller takes the highest priority event and for that clock cycle
initiates any Behaviours registered for that event type.

For example, a Subscriber that filters on bumper events receives a message whose event
type is Event.BUMPER_PORT (the left/port side bumper has been triggered). This Subscriber
passes the Payload of its Message to the Arbitrator. Since a bumper press is a relatively
high priority event it's likely that it will be the highest priority and is therefore
passed on to the Controller.  If an avoidance Behaviour &mdash; let's call it AVOID_PORT
&mdash; has been registered with the Controller, it is called and the robot will begin
whatever the AvoidPort behaviour entails, perhaps stopping, backing up while turning
clockwise, then proceeding forward again on a new trajectory.


Software Features
*****************

* message and event handling
* an asynchronous message bus that forms the basis of a `Subsumption Architecture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture>`_ [#f1]_, with an "exactly-once' message delivery guarantee
* YAML-based configuration
* timestamped, multi-level, colorised [#f2]_ logging
* written in Python 3 (currently 3.11.2)

.. [#f1] Uses finite state machines, an asynchronous message bus, an arbitrator and controller for task prioritisation.
.. [#f2] Colorised console output tested only on Unix/Linux operating systems.

Requirements
************

This library requires Python 3.8.5 or newer. It's currently being written using 
Python 3.11.2. Some portions (modules) of the KRZOS code will only run on a 
Raspberry Pi, though KRZOS Core should function independently of the various Pi 
libraries.

KRZOS requires installation of a number of dependencies (support libraries). 
There is currently no dependency management set up for this project.

First:

  sudo apt install python3-pip

then:

* numpy:        https://numpy.org/
    with:         sudo apt install python3-numpy
* psutil:       https://pypi.org/project/psutil/
    with:         sudo apt install python3-psutil

    with:         sudo pip3 install rgbmatrix5x5 --break-system-packages
* matrix11x7:   https://github.com/pimoroni/matrix11x7-python/tree/master
    with:         sudo pip3 install matrix11x7 --break-system-packages
* icm20948:     https://pypi.org/project/icm20948/
    with:         sudo pip3 install icm20948 --break-system-packages
* pyquaternion: https://pypi.org/project/pyquaternion/
*   with:         sudo pip3 install pyquaternion --break-system-packages
* IO Expander:  https://pypi.org/project/pimoroni-ioexpander/  
    with:         sudo pip3 install pimoroni-ioexpander --break-system-packages

    with:         sudo pip3 install gpiodevice --break-system-packages
* PAA5100JE:    https://github.com/pimoroni/pmw3901-python
    with:         sudo pip3 install pmw3901 --break-system-packages

for the VL53L5CX and 1.3" TFT display (used for its demo):

* VL53L1CX:     https://github.com/pimoroni/vl53l1x-python
    with:         sudo pip3 install vl53l1cx --break-system-packages
* VL53L5CX:     https://github.com/pimoroni/vl53l5cx-python
    with:         sudo pip3 install vl53l5cx-ctypes --break-system-packages
* ST7789:
    with:        sudo pip3 install st7789 --break-system-packages

    with:        sudo pip3 install --upgrade Pillow --break-system-packages
* matplotlib
    with:        sudo pip3 install matplotlib --break-system-packages

The pimoroni-iopxpander library supports the Pimoroni Breakout Garden 
IO Expander as well as the Encoder and Potentiometer.

The original PiconZero library has been included and significantly refactored as
a Python class, so it is not an external dependency.


Status
******

Early days. The Phase 0 hardware is largely complete and migration and conversion
of the `KROS-Core <https://github.com/ifurusato/kros-core/tree/main>`_ is being used
as the basis of MROS, which was forked to create KRZOS.

.. note::

   This project is currently in a very preliminary state.

   The project is being exposed publicly so that those interested can follow its progress.
